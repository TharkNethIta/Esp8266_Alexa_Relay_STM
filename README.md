# Esp8266_Alexa_Relay_STM
Hi!
This code is created to combine the use of physical house switches and automated relays to control the house light in both ways including ALEXA integration.
There are 2 switches, one is with two status: ON - OFF, one is just a trigger, so there is not ON and OFF but only TRIGGER.

Go to webpage.h and replace "SWITCH SCRIVANIA" at line 87 and 95 with your custom switch name!
